# Bidding-Lens-Atrribution

## Core attribution

## Final Project Intro ML
One of the most important digital marketing research topics is the mechanism that assigns conversion credits to individual marketing interactions. Indeed, attribution is used throughout online marketing, whether for budget decisions or the design of algorithmic bidders on which advertisers rely to purchase inventory. Nonetheless, an attribution definition on which everyone in the marketing community can agree has yet to be discovered. In this paper, I will look at the problem of a bidder who is subject to an attribution black box determined by the advertiser and needs to convert it into a bid. This naturally introduces a second level of attribution, which the bidder performs internally. For this task, I first formalize an often. Second, I characterize the solution to this problem, which we refer to as the core internal attribution, and show that it can be computed efficiently using a fixed-point method. Surprisingly, the core attribution is founded on a definition of marginality that differs from previous definitions, such as counterfactual marginality. Finally, I put our solution through its paces using a large publicly available dataset.
